descriptions, and status updates of varying lengths and complexity\n- Test TTS performance with large task lists and individual task details\n- Validate TTS for command confirmations and error

configuration persistence and potential concurrent operations, implement specific tests to prevent duplicate saves in the TTS context:\n\n- Test TTS configuration saves to prevent duplicate entries in configuration files when users rapidly change voice settings, volume, or other audio parameters\n- Validate that TTS engine initialization doesn't create duplicate configuration entries when switching between different TTS engines (Windows SAPI, macOS say, Linux espeak)\n- Test concurrent TTS operations to ensure audio output settings aren't duplicated when multiple commands with --tts flag run simultaneously\n- Verify that TTS preference saves are atomic and don't result in corrupted or duplicate configuration data during rapid user interactions\n- Implement unique constraint checks for TTS configuration entries to prevent duplicate voice profiles or audio settings\n- Test TTS configuration persistence across application restarts to ensure settings aren't duplicated on reload\n- Validate that TTS error logging doesn't create duplicate log entries when TTS engines fail or fallback mechanisms activate\n- Test edge cases where users rapidly toggle global TTS enable/disable settings to prevent duplicate configuration states\n- Ensure TTS-related task metadata (like audio output preferences per task) doesn't create duplicate entries in tasks.json\n- Implement locking mechanisms for TTS configuration file operations to prevent race conditions during concurrent access\n\nThis testing should be integrated with the existing TTS test strategy to ensure robust duplicate prevention

with audio output generation\n- Validate Claude API authentication and error handling when TTS commands request AI-generated content with --tts flag enabled\n- Test Claude API response parsing and integration with TTS output formatting to ensure AI-generated text is properly converted for speech synthesis\n- Verify Claude API token usage tracking doesn't conflict with TTS configuration persistence mechanisms\n- Test concurrent operations where Claude API calls and TTS audio generation occur simultaneously\n- Validate Claude API retry and backoff logic works correctly when TTS commands fail and need to regenerate content\n- Test Claude API integration with task generation workflows that include TTS output requirements\n- Ensure Claude API error messages are properly formatted for TTS output when --tts flag is enabled\n- Test Claude API model parameter configuration persistence alongside TTS configuration settings\n- Validate that Claude API failures gracefully fallback without breaking TTS functionality for existing task content\n- Test environment variable handling for ANTHROPIC_API_KEY in conjunction with TTS engine configuration\n- Verify Claude API integration logging doesn't create conflicts with TTS error logging mechanisms\n\nThis testing should ensure seamless integration between Claude API functionality and TTS features without interference

generation with --tts flag to ensure no duplicate task entries in tasks.json\n- Validate TTS preference persistence doesn't create duplicate configuration entries during rapid setting changes\n- Test concurrent TTS operations with multiple commands to verify no duplicate audio output settings\n- Simulate race conditions between TTS configuration saves and Claude API calls\n\n**Manual and Automated Test Execution:**\n- Execute TTS commands with --tts flag while monitoring tasks.json for duplicate entries\n- Test Claude API integration with TTS-enabled commands to verify single task creation\n- Validate TTS configuration file integrity after multiple rapid setting changes\n- Test TTS error logging to ensure no duplicate log entries during engine failures\n- Verify TTS-related task metadata saves don't create duplicate entries\n\n**Edge Case Testing for TTS Context:**\n- Test TTS configuration saves with minor variations (case sensitivity, whitespace) in voice names\n- Validate duplicate detection with similar TTS settings across different engines\n- Test large-scale TTS operations to ensure performance and correctness\n- Verify TTS global enable/disable toggle doesn't create duplicate configuration states\n\n**Validation and Documentation:**\n- Monitor TTS configuration files, tasks.json, and logs for any duplicate entries\n- Document test results in provided table format

The class must implement the Template Method pattern with the following structure:\n\n1. Keep constructor concise (under 10 lines) - only initialize apiKey and model properties\n2. Remove maxRetries and retryDelay from constructor - these should be class-level constants or configurable separately\n3. Implement all abstract methods from IAIProvider: generateCompletion, calculateTokens, getName, getModel, getDefaultModel\n4. Add protected template methods for extensibility:\n   - validateInput(input: string): void - for input validation with early returns\n   - prepareRequest(input: string, options?: any): any - for request preparation\n   - handleResponse(response: any): string - for response processing\n   - handleError(error: any): never - for consistent error handling\n5. Apply clean code principles: extract complex logic into small focused methods, use early returns to reduce nesting, ensure each method has single responsibility\n\nThe refactored BaseProvider will serve as a robust foundation using Template Method pattern, allowing concrete providers to override specific behaviors while maintaining consistent structure and error handling across all AI provider implementations.\n</info added on 2025-08-20T17:16:14.037Z>\n<info added on 2025-08-21T15:57:30.467Z>\nREFACTORING UPDATE: The BaseProvider implementation in packages/tm-core/src/providers/base-provider.ts is now affected by the core/ folder removal and needs its import paths updated.
