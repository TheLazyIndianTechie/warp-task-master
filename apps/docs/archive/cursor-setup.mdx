## Setting up Cursor AI Integration

<Check>
  Task Master is designed to work seamlessly with [Cursor AI](https://www.cursor.so/), providing a structured workflow for AI-driven development.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Using Cursor with MCP (Recommended)" icon="sparkles">
    If you've already set up Task Master with MCP in Cursor, the integration is automatic. You can simply use natural language to interact with Task Master:

    ```
    What tasks are available to work on next?
    Can you analyze the complexity of our tasks?
    I'd like to implement task 4. What does it involve?
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Manual Cursor Setup">
    If you're not using MCP, you can still set up Cursor integration:

    <Steps>
      <Step title="After initializing your project, open it in Cursor">
        The `.cursor/rules/dev_workflow.mdc` file is automatically loaded by Cursor, providing the AI with knowledge about the task management system
      </Step>
      <Step title="Place your PRD document in the scripts/ directory (e.g., scripts/prd.txt)">
        
      </Step>
      <Step title="Open Cursor's AI chat and switch to Agent mode">
        
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Alternative MCP Setup in Cursor">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Go to Cursor settings">
        
      </Step>
      <Step title="Navigate to the MCP section">
        
      </Step>
      <Step title="Click on 'Add New MCP Server'">
        
      </Step>
      <Step title="Configure with the following details:">
        - Name: "Task Master"
        - Type: "Command"
        - Command: "npx -y task-master-ai"
      </Step>
      <Step title="Save Settings">
        
      </Step>
    </Steps>
    Once configured, you can interact with Task Master's task management commands directly through Cursor's interface, providing a more integrated experience.

## Initial Task Generation

In Cursor's AI chat, instruct the agent to generate tasks from your PRD:

```
Please use the task-master parse-prd command to generate tasks from my PRD. The PRD is located at scripts/prd.txt.
```

The agent will execute:

```bash
task-master parse-prd scripts/prd.txt
```

This will:

- Parse your PRD document
- Generate a structured `tasks.json` file with tasks, dependencies, priorities, and test strategies
- The agent will understand this process due to the Cursor rules

### Generate Individual Task Files

Next, ask the agent to generate individual task files:

```
Please generate individual task files from tasks.json
```

The agent will execute:

```bash
task-master generate
```

This creates individual task files in the `tasks/` directory (e.g., `task_001.txt`, `task_002.txt`), making it easier to reference specific tasks.

## Custom Slash Commands

<Check>
  When you initialize Task Master with Cursor (`task-master init --cursor`), it automatically sets up custom slash commands for enhanced productivity.
</Check>

Task Master automatically copies its complete set of slash commands to `.cursor/commands/` during project initialization. This provides you with convenient shortcuts for all Task Master operations directly within Cursor's interface.

### Available Slash Commands

The following slash commands become available in Cursor after initialization:

<Accordion title="Core Workflow Commands">
  - `/tm-main` - Main Task Master help and overview
  - `/tm-next-task` - Get the next available task to work on
  - `/tm-show-task` - View detailed information about a specific task
  - `/tm-list-tasks` - Display all tasks with various filtering options
  - `/tm-project-status` - View overall project status
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Task Management Commands">
  - `/tm-add-task` - Add a new task to your project
  - `/tm-update-task` - Update an existing task
  - `/tm-set-status-*` - Change task status (to-pending, to-in-progress, to-done, etc.)
  - `/tm-remove-task` - Remove a task from your project
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Analysis and Planning Commands">
  - `/tm-parse-prd` - Generate tasks from a PRD document
  - `/tm-analyze-complexity` - Analyze task complexity
  - `/tm-complexity-report` - View complexity analysis report
  - `/tm-expand-task` - Break down tasks into subtasks
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Advanced Workflow Commands">
  - `/tm-smart-workflow` - Intelligent task workflow management
  - `/tm-auto-implement-tasks` - Automated task implementation pipeline
  - `/tm-command-pipeline` - Execute multiple Task Master commands in sequence
</Accordion>

### Using Slash Commands

Simply type the command name in Cursor's chat interface, and the AI will execute the corresponding Task Master operation:

```
/tm-next-task
```

The AI will understand the context and execute the appropriate `task-master` CLI command, providing you with the results directly in the chat.

### Command Cleanup

If you remove the Cursor profile from your project using `task-master remove --cursor`, the slash commands directory is automatically cleaned up to keep your project tidy.
